        "content": "Hello, my name is Luis, and I'm from Tucum√°n, Argentina. I'm currently seeking my first job as a software developer. I specialize in web development, particularly in frontend, although I also have knowledge in backend and can navigate both areas. In mid-2022, I discovered this beautiful world of programming, and since then, I've completed several projects that have helped shape my skills as a programmer. I always strive to find the most effective and straightforward solutions to problems. The technologies I enjoy working with the most are HTML, CSS, and React.I consider myself a highly committed and dedicated individual. Thanks to this commitment, I proudly obtained a tertiary degree in business administration and completed an intensive course as a full-stack developer, all while working in a different field and juggling other responsibilities. However, my passion for learning is far from over. I am an eternal learner, seeking continuous professional growth, eager to nurture my knowledge, and ready to contribute my ideas and skills to achieve any set objectives.",
